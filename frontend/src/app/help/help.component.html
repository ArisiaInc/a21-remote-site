<h2 id="overview">Arisia 2021 Technology Overview</h2>

<p>Most of this year’s online Arisia will take place through three platforms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Virtual Arisia Site</li>
  <li>Zoom</li>
  <li>Discord</li>
</ul>

<p>No one platform could support everything we wanted Arisia attendees to be able to do, but we tried to keep things as simple, familiar, and consistent as possible. Panels, workshops, and some socializing will happen via Zoom video chat, while Discord will host panel discussions and additional social text chat options.</p>

<p>Some performances may use other platforms like YouTube or Twitch, and Gaming will use gaming-specific platforms in addition to Zoom and Discord. The Virtual Arisia site will help keep everything connected and organized.</p>

<p id="setup">Visit our <a routerLink="/setup">Getting Set Up page</a> for reminders about how to set up your accounts.</p>

<p>Below you will find overviews of the different sites and apps we’re using, including links to detailed information on Zoom and Discord and information about how we’ll be using them at this year’s Arisia. Help Desk staff will be available throughout the convention if you have questions that aren’t answered here!</p>

<p><em>For those who want a guided tour of the convention site and the tools we’re using, we also invite you to attend one of our Navigating the Convention panels on both Friday and Saturday nights at 7:00 PM.</em></p>

<h2 id="virtual_arisia">Using the Virtual Arisia Site</h2>

<p>There are two ways you can use the Virtual Arisia site to find events and activities: the Schedule and the Con Hub.</p>

<p>The <b>Schedule</b> view of the site lists programming items, events, scheduled games, and their descriptions chronologically, and it allows you to search, filter, and save items. A schedule entry for an item will also link directly to the Zoom meeting or other location for that item.</p>

<p>The <b>Con Hub</b> view of the site includes everything and is more interactive. Browse the Art Show and Dealers Room! Check out what panels, events, or games are happening right now! See a slideshow of Arisia hallway costumes past and present! The choice is yours.</p>

<p>As you browse you may also notice two icons:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/fast_track.png" alt="Fast Track icon"> indicates that a panel or game is part of Fast Track and specifically for kids.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/family_friendly.png" alt="Family Friendly icon"> indicates that a panel or game is for all ages, but kids are enthusiastically welcome.</p>

<p>Finally, you have a <b>Profile</b> section in addition to your Con Hub and Schedule views. This section contains your Setting options, which are visible only to you, as well as your public Badge Ribbons and Duck Hunt progress markers. To share these public parts of your profile with other Arisia attendees, just send them the URL for your profile page.</p>

<h2 id="zoom">Using Zoom at Arisia</h2>

<p>If you’re new to Zoom, you can visit their website to learn more about using the <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/200305583-Desktop">desktop app</a>, the <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/200305413-Mobile">mobile apps</a>, or the <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/214629443-Zoom-web-client">in-browser version</a>.</p>

<h3 id="names">Names, Pronouns, Backgrounds, and Self View</h3>

<p>For each Zoom meeting or webinar you attend you’ll need to provide a name. Think of this as your badge at Arisia—you should set your name however you’d want it listed on your badge, along with the pronouns you’d like folks to use for you. If you already have an account, Zoom will usually default to the name listed in your profile, but you can change this for the weekend in your online Zoom account or you can change meeting-by-meeting.</p>

<p>Virtual backgrounds can be a way to keep your living space private or have some fun with your appearance. They do take extra computing power, though, and their effectiveness depends on how well your computer camera can tell the difference between you and the things behind you. If you want to use a virtual background, it’s a good idea to practice ahead of time and make sure it looks the way you want it to. Make sure that any images you use follow the <a href="https://www.arisia.org/Code-of-Conduct">Code of Conduct</a>, and please avoid video or moving backgrounds.</p>

<p>If you want to be on-camera but don’t want to see yourself, there’s now a “Hide Self View” option that allows you to do this. Hover over your video tile and then select the blue button with three dots in the top right corner. This should give you a menu with the Hide Self View option—you won’t see yourself, but you’ll still be visible to everyone else. To see yourself again, just hover over someone else’s tile, select that same button with the three dots, and select Show Self View.</p>

<h3 id="panels">Attending Panels</h3>

<p>Each panel will be listed as happening in a numbered Zoom “room,” which will correspond to the same numbered room in the Programming area of the Virtual Arisia site and to a “room-#” Discord channel. For example, panels in Zoom Room 1 can also be found behind Door 1 in the Programming Hub, and audience conversation and questions will be in the Discord channel #room-1. Virtual Arisia will not use named rooms for panels this year.</p>

<p>You can choose whether to have your camera on or off while attending a panel, but please keep your microphone muted so that everyone can hear the panelists. Use the Zoom Chat feature for technical questions.</p>

<h4 id="panel_qa">Panel Q&A</h4>

<p>For most panels, audience conversation and questions for panelists will happen in Discord, and questions there will be passed along to the moderator. If a moderator chooses to handle questions differently, they will explain this at the beginning of the panel. Discord will still be available for audience conversation.</p>

<p>After a panel has ended, panelists may choose to join the Discord channel to continue discussion and Q&A. Remember that just like in-person Arisia, panelists may need to go from one panel to the next and may not have time to linger in Discord.</p>

<h4 id="cc">Closed Captioning</h4>

<p>Some panels will have closed captions available; we will try to put this information into the Schedule description text beforehand whenever possible. Select the Closed Caption icon from the toolbar at the bottom of your screen to view captions.</p>

<p>To make the caption text larger or smaller, select the up arrow in the corner of your Stop or Start Video button, then select Video Settings, then select Accessibility. Use the slider to change the caption size.</p>

<h4 id="songs">Song Circles</h4>

<p>If you’re participating in a song circle and plan to lead a song, you may want to <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115003279466-Enabling-option-to-preserve-original-sound">enable original sound</a> ahead of time because that option can offer better sound quality for live music.</p>

<h4 id="meetups">Meetups</h4>

<p>Some meetups may use Zoom  breakout rooms to allow attendees to have more focused, smaller group discussions. The meetup hosts will let attendees know whether discussions are happening in the main Zoom room or in these breakout rooms.</p>

<h3 id="zoom_gaming_soc">Gaming and Social Spaces</h3>

<p>The Con Suite Zoom meeting offers a space for Arisia attendees to visit and video chat, either in the main meeting space or in smaller breakout rooms. Attendees whose Zoom apps are up to date can move in and out of breakout rooms on their own, and the Con Suite Zoom host can also help you navigate if you’re new to Zoom or have technical difficulties.</p>

<p>Gaming will also use Zoom to host breakout rooms for this year’s gaming tables and to provide a space for attendees to talk with gaming staff about what games are available to play.</p>

<h2 id="discord">Using Discord at Arisia</h2>

<p>Discord is a social platform that Arisia will be using for text-based socializing and discussions throughout the weekend. To use the Arisia Discord server, you will need a Discord account. If you’re new to Discord, you can visit <a href="https://discord.com/">their website</a> to learn more and to view their <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000217151">getting started guide</a>.</p>

<p>The Arisia Discord server is made up of many text channels, which are separate chat spaces. The channels are grouped into categories based on their purpose. A complete list of the categories and channels at Arisia is on the left side of your Discord window. Each channel name begins with a pound sign (#). To make scrolling easier, you can collapse each category by clicking on it. To learn more about the basics of using channels, check out the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord#h_d33e3809-909b-4720-899d-db26c17bafa9">Beginner’s Guide to Discord</a>.</p>

<p>Some categories and channels that are especially useful to look for are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Member Services</li>
    <ul>
      <li>#badge-setup</li>
      <li>#irt-hall-desk</li>
      <li>#safety</li>
      <li>#help-desk</li>
      <li>#announcements</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Safer Spaces</li>
    <ul>
      <li>#start-here (this channel will guide you into closed spaces)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Social Spaces</li>
    <ul>
      <li>#consuite</li>
      <li>#mezzanine</li>
      <li>#watch-party</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to participate in discussion during a panel or event, look for the Discord channel that corresponds with the location of the panel or event on the virtual site. For example, discussion for a panel occurring in Zoom Room 1 will be in #room-1 in the Programming and Events category.</p>

<p>When a channel has content you have not read, it will appear bolded and bright white in the channel list. An “unread content” message will also appear as you scroll through the channel list. If you are not interested in being alerted to new content in a particular channel or category, you can mute it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On the desktop client, right-click the category or channel and select “Mute” either for a set time or until manually unmuted.</li>
  <li>On the mobile app, tap and hold the category or channel and select “Mute” from the menu that appears.</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about muting channels and other notification settings, look at <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/215253258-Notifications-Settings-101">Notification Settings 101</a> on the Discord website.</p>

<p>Arisia Discord does not include voice channels. Voice/video socializing is available in the Zoom Con Suite.</p>

<h3 id="discord_roles">Discord Roles</h3>

<p>Discord users can be assigned different attributes, called “roles”. Roles appear in your Discord User Profile, which is visible to others by clicking on your name or picture. Roles may provide information about you, or give access to specific spaces within the server. Think of roles like ribbons that you can add the same way you would add ribbons to a badge at Arisia. You are able to add the following roles to your own User Profile on the Arisia server:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pronouns</li>
  <li>Interests</li>
  <li>Do not PM/DM</li>
</ul>

<p>To add these roles to your Discord User Profile, go to the #badge-setup channel. There you will see messages that list the available options for each category of role. Each option corresponds to a “reaction”, or emoji, that appears below the list. To add a role, click the reaction that matches the desired role. You can select as many as you like from each category. To remove a role, click the reaction again.</p>

<p>Some people also have additional roles that indicate their position as a convention staff member or volunteer. These roles will be visible in their Discord User Profile and give their name a special color. If you need help, look for people with these colors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Red/pink - IRT, Safety, Con Chair (red is the new black ribbon for Arisia 2021)</li>
  <li>Teal - Division or Area Head</li>
  <li>Yellow - Tech, Help Desk</li>
  <li>Blue - Staff</li>
</ul>
<p>When participating in discussions or Q&As, you may also notice purple users:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bright purple - Guest of Honor</li>
  <li>Darker purple - Artist, Dealer, Program Participant</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are participating in a LARP at Arisia, you will also need to add a special LARP role to access the game. There is an individual role for each LARP. You can add the LARP role or roles you need using the same reaction/emoji method as the roles above, but in the #larps channel under Gaming. Please only add roles for LARPs you have signed up for.</p>

<h3 id="discord_etiquette">Discord Etiquette</h3>

<p>The Arisia Discord server is an Arisia space, so you must abide by the <a hre="https://www.arisia.org/Code-of-Conduct">Code of Conduct</a> when posting.</p>

<p>Consider channels in the Arisia Discord to be public space, meaning that anyone attending Arisia can see what you are saying if they enter the channel. Discord keeps chat history, so people who enter a channel after a conversation has happened are able to scroll back and see what was typed.  When in programming channels, be considerate of the channel’s purpose, and move to a different channel when your panel ends. Room hosts will remind you of this as needed.</p>

<p>If you wish to have a private conversation, you can do so by <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/223657667-Group-Chat-and-Calls">creating a direct message</a> (DM) with a friend or friends. During the convention, conversations that begin on the Arisia Discord may move into private interactions on Discord.  This does not mean that the Arisia Code of Conduct suddenly fails to apply to those interactions.  Please be respectful in your interactions with other Arisia attendees, regardless of whether you are officially in "Arisia space", in the same way that we would ask you to be respectful of other Arisia attendees while standing outside of the Arisia hotel (assuming that you were willing to venture into the icy cold).</p>

<p>Since DMs are hosted on Discord’s servers, your name in the DM chat will initially appear as the Discord username you created when you signed up. Since this may not be the badge name displayed on the Arisia server, it’s polite to identify yourself again when starting a DM.</p>

<p>Please also be considerate of spoilers for media or publications. If you wish to comment on something and do not want to ruin it for someone else who might see your post, you can <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022320632-Spoiler-Tags-">hide your spoiler</a> by highlighting the text and clicking the “spoiler tag” icon in the text format menu that appears, or by sandwiching your spoiler in || marks (for example, ||here is my spoiler!|| and the rest of my message). If you wish to view a spoiler someone else has hidden, click the hidden text to reveal it.</p>

<p>While in general we recommend hiding spoilers, there is a “spoiler zone” available for WandaVision in honor of its premier during the convention. To access this channel, add the Westview role to your account in the #badge-setup channel.</p>

<h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>

<p>In addition to Zoom and Discord, Gaming will use other apps like <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/gamelist">Board Game Arena</a> and <a href="https://tabletopia.com/games?">Tabletopia</a>, through which Arisia attendees will be able to play games together online. Arisia also has a Minecraft server and will be running community sessions of Among Us and Jackbox Games. For more information, see the <a href="https://arisia.org/Gaming">Gaming page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance Hall</h2>

<p>Events in the Performance Hall are streamed from other services like YouTube and Twitch and embedded into our Virtual Arisia site. You don’t need to go anywhere to watch them, and there will be a Performance Hall Discord channel for conversation just like there are channels for the programming rooms.inks to the original sources will be available as well.</p>

<h2 id="access">Accessibility</h2>

<p>We have worked to design the Virtual Arisia site in keeping with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, including alt text descriptions of all Art Show and Dealers Room images. We kept animations on the Virtual Arisia site to a minimum, and you can turn them off entirely in your Profile settings. We are also providing CART real-time captioning for many panels.</p>

<p>For more information on Zoom and accessibility, visit <a href="https://zoom.us/accessibility">https://zoom.us/accessibility</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about accessibility or if you would like to request some sort of accommodation, please send an email message to <a href="mailto:access@arisia.org">access@arisia.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="help">Where to Go for Help</h2>

<p>There are three groups primarily responsible for providing different help during the convention:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Help Desk</li>
  <li>Safety</li>
  <li>The Incident Response Team</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information and links to contact each group in the <a href="/map">Lobby</a> area of the Con Hub.</p>
