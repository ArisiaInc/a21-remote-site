<h1>Getting Set Up for Arisia 2021</h1>

<p>Most of this year’s online Arisia will take place through three platforms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Virtual Arisia Site</li>
  <li>Zoom</li>
  <li>Discord</li>
</ul>

<h2>Virtual Arisia Site</h2>

<p>Your Virtual Arisia account is the same account you used to register for the convention and sign the Code of Conduct. If you do not remember your username and password, go to <a href="https://reg.arisia.org" target="_blank">reg.arisia.org</a>, select “reset password,” and type in the e-mail address you used to register. The password reset process will also remind you of your username.</p>

<h2>Zoom</h2>

<p>Creating a (free) Zoom account will allow you to save settings like your name and pronouns you want others to see while you’re in Arisia Zoom sessions. An account is not required to use Zoom, to download and use their app, or to access Arisia’s Zoom content.</p>

<p>Zoom has an app that you can <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362233" target="_blank">download</a> for your computer or mobile device. You can also use Zoom in your browser, but some features are not available or don’t work as well this way.</p>

<p>If you already have Zoom downloaded, you’ll want to <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362393" target="_blank">check which version</a> you’re running and <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362233-Upgrade-update-to-the-latest-version" target="_blank">update</a> to at least version 5.3.1.</p>

<p>If you already have an account, you may want to check the information visible in your Zoom <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363203-Customizing-your-profile" target="_blank">profile</a>, especially if the name and photo you want to display during the convention are different from the name and photo you normally display for work or personal use. You can also change your name for an individual meeting, which will not affect the default name listed in your profile.</p>

<p>Finally, you’re welcome to use a <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background" target="_blank">virtual background</a>, but make sure it follows the <a href="https://www.arisia.org/Code-of-Conduct" target="_blank">Code of Conduct</a>, and please avoid video backgrounds, which can be distracting or disorienting for some people.</p>

<h2>Discord</h2>

<p>Discord requires an account, which you can make on the <a href="https://discord.com/register" target="_blank">Discord website</a>. Once you make an account, you can download the Discord app (for computer or mobile) or open the web browser version.</p>

<p>Once you have created a Discord account, you will need to join the Arisia Discord server and connect your Discord account to the Virtual Arisia site to verify your membership. Click any Discord link on the Virtual Arisia site to access and confirm you wish to join the Arisia Discord server.

<p>Once you have connected to the server, you need to verify your membership on the Virtual Arisia site. This gives you access to the Arisia Discord server content. On the Virtual Arisia site, go to your <a routerLink="/user" target="_blank">Profile page</a> and scroll down to the “My Setup” section. Type your Discord username, including the pound sign (#) and 4 digits following it, into the box and click the Submit button.</p>

<p> Now the Arisia Discord server will be unlocked!</p>

<p>Your name on the Arisia Discord server will update to the badge name you entered when you registered for the convention. If you would like to change how your name is displayed, please go to the <a href="https://reg.arisia.org" target="_blank">Arisia registration page</a> and change your badge name.</p>
