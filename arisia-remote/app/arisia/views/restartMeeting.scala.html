  <h1>Force-Stop a Meeting</h1>

  <p>This is only for the situation where you *know* that for some reason that a meeting is utterly broken.
  Usually, this is only for long-dead meetings that are clogging up the view.

  <h1>Restart Meeting</h1>

  <p>This should only be used in the extreme case where a Zoom Host has accidentally shut a Program Item down
  prematurely. In that case, put the item's ID (the number identifying it in the schedule) here, to reboot
  the Zoom meeting.</p>
